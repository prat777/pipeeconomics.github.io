<p>The US water Infrastructure dates back to the 1840s, where steel pipes where prominent to build the expansive and behemoth-like water networks for big cities and small towns across all of America. Today is the year 2015, and now the US water infrastructure loses 50.7 billion dollars annually, because the 100 year old pipes burst, break and leak away 2.6 trillion gallons of water annually.  </p>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>The ultrasonic detection system consists of an ultrasonic transceiver that sends and receives ultrasonic waves of frequencies 20 kHz to approximately 7GHz. An ultrasonic transceiver will subject the water main with specified frequencies, where signals that return or bounce back due to a change in density within the pipe, which will be mapped by the device to create a 2-d image of the condition of the pipe; where the life expectancy and level of corrosion can be interpolated by the system, so when the system detects any sign of corrosion, it can immediately report back to the company operator of the condition of the pipe. These ultrasonic detection devices communicate using an Ethernet connection, and will work around the clock to monitor the condition of the water main, until imminent failure.</p>
